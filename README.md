# Mandelbrot Set Visualizer

A simple Mandelbrot Set visualizer implemented using WebGL. This project allows you to explore the Mandelbrot Set by navigating through it using keyboard controls. The visualization is interactive, with real-time rendering of the fractal.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senlak/mandelbrot-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Open `mandelbrot.html` in a modern web browser that supports WebGL.

3. Use the following keyboard controls to interact with the visualizer:

   - **W, A, S, D**: Move the center of the view.
   - **Arrow Up, Arrow Down**: Zoom in and out.
   - **Arrow Left, Arrow Right**: Adjust intensity.
   - **C**: Change the color scheme.

## Browser Compatibility
